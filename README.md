# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Prediction with Decision Tree

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that can predict the species of *Iris* flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal characteristics.  
The dataset used is the classic and widely known **Iris Dataset**.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy  

## ðŸ§  Model
Model used: **Decision Tree Classifier**  
Reasons for choosing:
- Easy to interpret and visualize  
- Suitable for relatively small datasets  
- No need for feature normalization  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 100%  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 100%  

ðŸ‘‰ This means the model was able to perfectly classify all data in this dataset.

## âœ… Conclusion
- The **Decision Tree** model is highly effective for the Iris dataset.  
- Since this dataset is simple and well-separated among classes, achieving 100% accuracy is very possible.  
- However, for more complex datasets, this model might require parameter tuning to avoid overfitting.
